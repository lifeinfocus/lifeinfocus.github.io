<p>On the Wellness side of the spectrum I concentrate of the benefits of Essential Oils and their amazing healing properties that create a life of health and wellness in a pure and natural way.  Essential Oils are derived from plants, trees, shrubs, roots, and seeds.  One single drop of an Essential oil is capable of delivering therapeutic benefits to most every system of the body.  </p>
